# Crop-and-Yield-Prediction
This project leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to assist farmers and agricultural experts in making informed decisions about crop selection and yield estimation. By analyzing key environmental and soil parameters such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil type, pH, and nutrient levels (NPK), the system predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate and forecasts expected yield.

The core of the application includes machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree, trained on agricultural datasets to ensure accurate and region-specific recommendations. A Flask-based web interface allows users to input data manually or through voice, making the system accessible and user-friendly.

ðŸ’» Technologies & Languages Used Python â€“ For building machine learning models and backend logic.

Flask â€“ Lightweight web framework used to develop the web interface.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€“ To design and enhance the user interface.

JavaScript Web APIs â€“ For voice input and interaction features.

Pandas & Scikit-learn â€“ For data preprocessing and implementingÂ MLÂ algorithms
